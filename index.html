      Born Tahj Malik Chandler on July 17, 1994, Saba (sometimes stylized as SABA) is
      a Chicago performing artist, rapper and producer from the Austin neighborhood of
      westside Chicago. Many might recognize him from features on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eedeXTWZUn8">Angels</a>
      by Chance the Rapper and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Gg4lMzezc">Shadow Man</a>
      by Noname. Looking to follow in the footsteps of his father, who was an R&B musician himself,
      Saba taught himself to play the piano by the age of 10. He started immersing himself into the
      Chicago open mic scene during his days at St. Joseph's High School, at which point he
      also started passing around his own mixtapes in school hallways under the moniker of "Sabo-tahj."

    </div>
    <div class = "col col-lg-4">
      Saba would graduate St. Joseph's with a 3.5 GPA at the age of
      16 and subsequently matriculate at Columbia College in Chicago. Eventually,
      however, Saba would drop out to co-found the rap crew PIVOT Gang with his
      cousin and friend Walter Long Jr., who performed as John Walt. This would lead to Saba
      falling out with his grandfather, however, who believed that he had more potential in
      school and would be making the same mistakes as his father. To make matters worse, February 8th, 2017
      would prove to be one of the darkest days in Saba's life; John Walt was robbed for his jacket
      on a Chicago train and subsequently stabbed. Police pronounced him dead on the scene at 3:52 pm.

      Saba would continue to tour for his 2016 album, Bucket List Project, but it wasn't particularly easy
      as described in <a href = "https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/11/15/563419986/to-be-rare-true-and-free">a 2017 NPR story​.</a>
      At the end of every show, Saba would lead crowds into chanting "Long Live John Walt!"
      as a sort of coping ritual. Saba and his team would then proclaim Nov. 25th as John Walt Day and wrap
      up 2017 with a sold-out Chicago show where all ticket proceeds went to the <a href = "https://www.johnwaltfoundation.org/">John Walt Foundation​</a>:
      a non-profit launched earlier in the year with John Walt's mother to fund local arts programs for Chicago youth.
      Saba would then take a three-month hiatus from social media as fans wondered about
      his mental health and well-being.

    <div class = "col col-lg-4">
      Investing all of his time into working on music with producers daedaePIVOT and Daoud, Saba would
      focus on his relationships, mental health, grief and spirituality to eventually manifest
      them into themes for his new album: CARE FOR ME​. Shortly following its April release date,
      CARE FOR ME rapidly became one of 2018's most critically acclaimed albums, including being
      named the <a href = "https://djbooth.net/features/2018-12-11-best-albums-2018-ranked">#1 Hip-Hop album of 2018 by DJBooth​</a>
      (beating out albums like DAYTONA, ASTROWORLD and Swimming). Currently, Saba is touring Europe and North America
      in support of CARE FOR ME.

Standouts include CALLIGRAPHY, PROM/KING and HEAVEN ALL AROUND ME.
