      Born Tahj Malik Chandler on July 17, 1994, Saba (sometimes stylized as SABA) is
      a Chicago performing artist, rapper and producer from the Austin neighborhood of
      westside Chicago. Many might recognize him from features on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eedeXTWZUn8">Angels</a>
      by Chance the Rapper and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Gg4lMzezc">Shadow Man</a>
      by Noname. Looking to follow in the footsteps of his father, who was an R&B musician himself,
      Saba taught himself to play the piano by the age of 10. He started immersing himself into the open mic scene during his days at St. Joseph's High School, at which point he
      also started passing around his own mixtapes in school hallways under the moniker of "Sabo-tahj."

    </div>
    <div class = "col col-lg-4">
      Saba would graduate St. Joseph's with a 3.5 GPA at the age of
      16 and subsequently matriculate at Columbia College in Chicago. Eventually,
      however, Saba would drop out to co-found the rap crew PIVOT Gang with his
      cousin Walter Long Jr., who performed as John Walt. This would lead to Saba
      falling out with his grandfather, however, who believed that he had more potential in
      school and would be making the same mistakes as his father. In February 2017, just
      weeks before the start of his first headlining tour, Saba ​was struck by
      tragedy. John Walt was fatally stabbed coming off of a CTA train in Chicago.

      With a heavy heart, as documented in <a href = "https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/11/15/563419986/to-be-rare-true-and-free">a feature story by NPR​</a>,
      Saba delivered emotional performances on tours spanning North America and Europe in
      support of his 2016 release Bucket List Project​. Proclaiming Long’s birthday,
      Nov. 25th, as John Walt Day, Saba concluded the year with a sold-out hometown
      concert where all proceeds went to the John Walt Foundation​, which he
      launched earlier in the year alongside Long’s mother to generate funds
      for local youth with interest in the arts. Saba would then take a three-month
      hiatus from social media following John Walt Day, as fans questioned his whereabouts
      and mental health.

      Centering his focus on creating new music while working alongside producers
      Daoud ​and daedaePIVOT ​at home in Chicago and at a rented bed-and-breakfast in
      Oakland, CA, Saba honed in on social anxiety and relationships with family
      and God as the linchpins of his new album, CARE FOR ME​. In the weeks leading
      up to the April 5 release of the album, Saba shared video singles “BUSY”​ and “LIFE”​,
      which have respectively been featured in top tier playlists including Apple Music’s
      The A-List​ and Spotify’s Most Necessary​. CARE FOR ME has earned high critical praise,
      including being named Best New Music by Pitchfork​. Saba is currently spanning North America
      and Europe on his CARE FOR ME TOUR​ in support of the album’s release.
